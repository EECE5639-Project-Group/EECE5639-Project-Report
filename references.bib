	abstract = {Diabetes is a condition of increase in the blood sugar level higher than the normal range. Prolonged diabetes damages the small blood vessels in the retina resulting in diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR progresses with time without any noticeable symptoms until the damage has occurred. Hence, it is very beneficial to have the regular cost effective eye screening for the diabetes subjects. This paper documents a system that can be used for automatic mass screenings of diabetic retinopathy. Four classes are identified: normal retina, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and macular edema (ME). We used 238 retinal fundus images in our analysis. Five different texture features such as homogeneity, correlation, short run emphasis, long run emphasis, and run percentage were extracted from the digital fundus images. These features were fed into a support vector machine classifier (SVM) for automatic classification. SVM classifier of different kernel functions (linear, radial basis function, polynomial of order 1, 2, and 3) was studied. Receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted to select the best classifier. Our proposed system is able to identify the unknown class with an accuracy of 85.2\%, and sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of 98.9\%, 89.5\%, and 0.972 respectively using SVM classifier with polynomial kernel of order 3. We have also proposed a new integrated DR index (IDRI) using different features, which is able to identify the different classes with 100\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To describe the optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography features of diabetic retinopathy

Methods
Using a 70kHz OCT and the split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm, 6 Ã— 6 mm 3-dimensional angiograms of the macula of 4 patients with diabetic retinopathy were obtained and compared with fluorescein angiography (FA) for features catalogued by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study.

Results
OCT angiography detected enlargement and distortion of the foveal avascular zone, retinal capillary dropout, and pruning of arteriolar branches. Areas of capillary loss obscured by fluorescein leakage on FA were more clearly defined on OCT angiography. Some areas of focal leakage on FA that were thought to be microaneurysms were found to be small tufts of neovascularization that extended above the inner limiting membrane.

Conclusion
OCT angiography does not show leakage, but can better delineate areas of capillary dropout and detect early retinal neovascularization. This new noninvasive angiography technology may be useful for routine surveillance of proliferative and ischemic changes in diabetic retinopathy.},
