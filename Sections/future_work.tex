A key area of interest is the development of an image segmentation system that can delineate detailed structures within fundus images. Current limitations stem from the precision required in labeling segmentation masks, a task that demands specialized medical expertise. Collaborating with clinicians to label these fine masks accurately would enable us to enhance our model's understanding of the spatial relationships and exact boundaries of lesions associated with diabetic retinopathy.

Moreover, integrating segmentation with our existing classification model could significantly refine its performance. Segmentation masks could serve not only to validate the areas of interest identified by the saliency maps but also to quantify aspects such as the area affected by different classes of retinopathy. This quantitative data could be invaluable in training more sophisticated machine learning models that consider the extent and specific locations of retinopathy signs as factors in their predictions.

Another promising direction involves tracking the progression of diabetic retinopathy over time. By developing algorithms that analyze sequential fundus images of the same patients, we can gain insights into the evolution of the disease. This longitudinal analysis would allow for more personalized and timely treatment decisions, potentially slowing or even reversing the progression of retinopathy.

Finally, integrating findings from existing literature into our models through the use of regularization techniques based on prior knowledge stands to significantly improve model performance and reliability. By incorporating constraints derived from the extensive literature on diabetic retinopathy and related pathologies, we can guide the learning process of our models to adhere more closely to clinically observed patterns. This regularization could help mitigate the effects of overfitting and improve generalization to new, unseen data by aligning our model's inferences with established medical knowledge.
