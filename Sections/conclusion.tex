This project has demonstrated the potential of computer vision models in enhancing the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy through fundus camera images. By employing the AUC-ROC metric, which is particularly effective in conditions of class imbalance, the model achieved a robust ability to distinguish between different severity levels of retinopathy. Furthermore, the generation of saliency maps provided visual confirmation of the regions in the images that influenced the model's decisions, highlighting the model's capacity to identify clinically relevant features.

The model shows strong predictive performance and the insights gained from the saliency maps pave the way for more intricate explorations into image-based diagnostic processes. Future efforts could focus on advancing towards image segmentation to gain more detailed diagnostic information and on leveraging sequential image data to track the progression of retinopathy over time. Additionally, incorporating medical expertise into the labeling process and integrating established clinical knowledge into machine learning models through regularization would enhance the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic tools.

As we continue to bridge the gap between technical capabilities and clinical needs, the prospect of AI-driven tools becoming a staple in diagnostics is increasingly feasible. These tools promise not only to enhance diagnostic precision but also to enable earlier interventions, potentially altering the course of diabetic retinopathy for countless patients.
